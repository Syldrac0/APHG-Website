            <h1>Culture</h1>
            <h2>Folk vs Popular culture</h2>
            <p>In folk culture it is a lot more centralized and nieche, it focuses on the land of that area and whatnot. On the other hand, pop culture is very genral and globalized. Pop culture tends to harm the enviroment more than folk culture simply because it has more adherents. Folk culture ussually links with the enviroment to dictate clothing, cuisne and other factors. </p>
            <h2>Swedish Folk Culture</h2>
            
            <img src="../Images/music-folk.png" alt="sheet music">

            <p>One large element of culture is music; Sweden's folk music traditionally relies on the fiddle and is genrally a waltz, polska, or polka.</p>
            <h2>Affects of Pop Culture on Sweden</h2>
            <img class="logos"src="../Images/logo-sheet.jpeg" alt="brand names">

            <p>Swedes used to dress in dresses and suits but since american culture has been globalized, most swedes just dress in american clothes and more casual outfits.</p>

            <h2>The Language Tree</h2>
            <p>There is a long line to show how languages relate to each other called the language tree; It is a 4 depth tree: language family, which is a group of languages that share a linguistic ancestor from pre-recorded history; language branch, which share a common language family; language group, which all share a common language branch; and language dialect, a small regional varience in languages like pronuciation and some words.</p>
            
            <h2>Swedens Languages</h2>
            
            <p>Most non-native languages came from relocation diffusion. There are a few different dialects of Swedish like Göta, Svea, Skåne, Uppland, När Socken; The dialects that helped make proper Swedish were Göta and Svea. While Swedish is still more commonly spoken and is the official language of Sweden, more that 80% of the population knows English, the biggest lingua franca. </p>

            <h2>Universalizing vs Ethnic Religions</h2>
            <p>There are two types of religions, ethnic and universalizing. Universalizing is a more broad religion that is aimed towards more that one culture; Ethnic religions are very specific and based around <b>one</b> culture, they will often times be heavily associated with the surrounding land and nature.</p>
